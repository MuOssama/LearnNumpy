# Intro
**Content**

1- **Numpy include**\
2- **Indexing**\
3- **Dimentions**

## 1 Numpy include
> ``` import numpy as np ```

its good to give numpy alias as np to get used toother codes and to write code faster
## 2 Creating arrays
>  ``` zeroDim = np.array(10)``` #10 is 0D array\
> ``` oneDim = np.array([1,2,3])``` #[1,2,3] is 1D array\
> ``` twoDim = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])``` #[[1,2],[3,4]] is 2D array\
> ``` threeDim = np.array([[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]])``` #[ [ [[1,2],[3,4] ] , [ [5,6],[7,8] ] ] is 3D array

Note: when coding with vscode, you could download bracket pair colorizer 2 plugin, this plugin will make it easier deal with multi-dim array

## 3 Indexing
1- normal indexing
2- simplfied indexing
## 4 Dimentions
1- determine the dimention
2-build the array with specified dime np.arrat([],ndim=3)
